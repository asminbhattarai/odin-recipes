          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Sel roti is a traditional, sweet, ring-shaped Nepali bread or
            doughnut made from rice flour and deep-fried until golden brown. It
            is commonly prepared during festivals like Dashain and Tihar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to good sel roti is achieving the right batter
            consistency—slightly thicker than regular batter, but still
            pourable.
          </p>

        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <section>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups uncooked rice, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup water (as needed for blending)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee for deep-frying</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp ghee (optional, for batter)</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp cardamom powder (optional)</li>
            <li>Mashed banana, grated coconut, or sesame seeds (optional)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <section>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Wash the uncooked rice and soak it overnight.</li>

            <li>
              Drain the water and transfer the soaked rice to a blender or food
              processor.
            </li>

            <li>Add sugar, milk, water, salt, and any optional ingredients.</li>

            <li>
              Blend the mixture, adding water gradually, until it forms a thick
              but smooth, pourable batter.
            </li>

            <li>
              Transfer the batter to a bowl, cover with a clean cloth or paper
              towel, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours).
            </li>

            <li>
              After resting, check the batter consistency. If it is too thick,
              add a little water at a time until pourable.
            </li>

            <li>
              Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat. The oil is
              ready when a small drop of batter sizzles and turns golden.
            </li>

            <li>
              Pour the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to form a
              ring shape. You can pour the batter using:
              <ul>
                <li>A piping bag or ziplock bag with a small corner cut off</li>
                <li>A funnel or a plastic bottle cut in half</li>
                <li>Your hands or directly from the bowl (if experienced)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Fry until the sel roti turns golden brown and puffs up.</li>

            <li>Carefully flip using two long metal or wooden sticks.</li>

            <li>
              Once the other side is golden brown, remove from the oil and drain
              excess oil on paper towels.
            </li>

            <li>
              Serve sel roti hot with pickle, potato curry, tea, or any side
              dish of your choice.
            </li>
          </ol>
